# Dice-Rolling-Simulator
Dice Rolling Simulator (Python)
# Overview
The Dice Rolling Simulator is a fun, interactive Python console application that simulates rolling a dice.
Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6, displays a creative message using emojis, and automatically rolls again when a six is rolled.
This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates core Python concepts in an engaging way.

# Technologies Used
Python 3
random module

# Features
Random dice roll between 1 and 6
Uses Python match-case for clean decision handling
Automatically re-rolls when a 6 is rolled 🎉
User-friendly messages with emojis
Allows multiple dice rolls until the user exits

# How the Program Works
The program welcomes the user.
The user presses Enter to roll the dice.
A random number (1–6) is generated.
A custom message is displayed based on the result.
If the result is 6, the dice rolls again automatically.
The user is asked whether they want to roll again.
The program exits when the user chooses n.

# Sample output
Welcome to the Dice Rolling Simulator! 🎲
Press Enter to roll the dice...
5️⃣ Nice! You’re just one away from a six
Roll again? (y/n): y
Press Enter to roll the dice...
6️⃣ BOOM! A perfect six!
🎉 Since you hit a six, we're rolling again automatically...

# Learning Outcomes
